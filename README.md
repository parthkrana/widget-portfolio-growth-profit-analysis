# Widget Sales and Margin Analysis

![Invoice Amount and Country Codes](Dashboard-1.png)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the revenue, gross margin, and regional performance of a global widget manufacturer whose products are used widely across Fortune 500 companies. The client sells roughly ten widget varieties through sales teams operating in four geographic regions. Due to years of neglected data processes and controls, the organization lacked clear visibility into customer profitability, product performance, and margin trends.

Using Tableau, I developed an interactive performance dashboard to evaluate revenue trends, budget variance, customer profitability, and regional margin behavior. The goal of the analysis is to surface high-value opportunities, highlight margin risks, and support more informed commercial and operational decisions.

## Key Insights
- **Revenue Strength:** YTD revenue reached approximately **51M**, with most months outperforming planned budgets.
- **Margin Expansion:** Gross margin improved significantly from **40% to 80%**, indicating better pricing discipline and cost efficiency.
- **Top Customer Profitability:** Several enterprise clients delivered margins near **100%**, making them strong candidates for strategic expansion.
- **Regional Variation:** The **Northeast region** generated the highest revenue but held only **51% margin**, suggesting cost pressure or discounting impacts.
- **Product Mix Impact:** Higher-margin widget varieties drove peak profitability, creating opportunities to steer sales focus toward more profitable products.
